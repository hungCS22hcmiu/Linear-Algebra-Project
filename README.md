# Determinant Calculator
**My simple project for Linear Algebra Course:** A Python application to calculate the determinant of a square matrix, there are two versions of the calculator.<br>
**The version using Numpy:<br>**

**The second version is used Laplace Expansion that i learn in Linear Algebra Course:**<br>
Applying Laplace Expasion recursively to compute determinant, and the two approaches give the same value.
